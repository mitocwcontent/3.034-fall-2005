Grading Policy
--------------

Students are encouraged to work together on problem sets and laboratory experiment analysis, but must prepare write-ups for these assignments individually. Students must work independently on exams. Grades will be distributed as follows:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Six Problem Sets | 10% |
| Laboratory Experiments | 30% |
| Three Exams (including Final) | 60% (20% each) 

Laboratory Grading
------------------

As will be discussed at the first recitation, each laboratory includes a short quiz at the start of the session, and an independent written assignment. Prof. Van Vliet grades all quizzes and laboratory assignments, and will handle excused / unexcused absences related to the laboratory experiments. Late arrivals and unexcused absences receive a zero for that laboratory experiment.
